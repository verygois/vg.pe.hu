<p>Jeff Witscher | ジェフ・ウィッチャー</p>
  <p>1983年にカリフォルニア・ロングビーチで生まれました。現在はポートランドで自身の清掃会社「Vincent's Expert Cleaners」を管理しています。彼はこれまでに数多くの名義を使い分けて精力的に音楽作品を発表していました。おそらく最も知らている名義はRene Hellでしょう。 また熱烈 なチェスプレイヤーであり、近年は清掃業と読書とチェスを中心とした生活を送っているそうです。<br/>
オーガニック・フィールド・レコーディングと電子音をハイブリットした彼の音楽が持つ最大の魅力は、飾り気の無い美しさ 。 ライブ・パフォーマンス では、より繊細かつ壮大な物語性のある表現を試みます。</p>

  <p>Eric Frye | エリック・フライ</p>
  <p>アメリカを拠点とする作曲家、アーティスト、キュレーター。彼はこれまでに細分化され続けた実験音楽におけるジャンルの境界を超越した、数学や言語学に基づいた彼独自の哲学による音響の在り方を探求しています。<br/>マルチチャンネル音響を用いて複数のレイヤーを持った音を空間に配置する彼のライブ・パフォーマンスやインスタレーションは、聴覚で動きや物質を表現すると同時に、耳では感知できえない音の波形（コンピューター上に現れる音の形で描かれたドローイング）や、空白（無音を用いて目に見えない物体を創り上げるかのようなインスタレーション）などを主題とした従来の音楽的価値観では捉えきれない表現にも感じられるはずでしょう。</p>

  <p>Matthew Sullivan | マシュー・サリバン</p>
  <p>ロサンゼルスのサウンド・アーティスト。過去には Earn などの名義で数多くの作品を発表、近年はSean McCann とのコラボレーションを頻繁に行っています。<br/>
2016年に本名名義では初となるソロアルバム「Skene（ Recital ）」をリリース。 打楽器、具体音、電子音をコラージュし不透明な物語を創造します。<br/>
2007年から2012年にはカセットレーベルEkheinを運営。現在は、アーマンド・ハマー美術館やロサンゼルス現代美術館にて演奏を行うなど、ロサンゼルスを拠点に多数の公的・私的イベントをキュレーションしています。</p>

  <p>Z.B. Aids | Z.B. エイズ</p>
  <p>1998年から1999年の間にすべてが始まった。(No Name) が Hélicoptère Sanglante となり、一時的にAfrican DiscothèqueとThaï Horseという名義に分かれ、その後にPopol Gluant、最終的に（=現在）Z.B. Aids a.k.a. Valerie Smith として活動している。</p>
    <p>ヘンドリク・ヘグレー（グラフィック・ジンと現代アートのシーンで進化するビジュアルアーティストであり、Nazi Knife と False Flag マガジンの共同運営者。2014年にPrix Ricardにノミネートされ、近年Paraguay PressのJonas Delabordeとの壮大なコラボレーション・ブックを出版）のソロ音楽プロジェクトは、電子/磁気音楽を独創的なビジョンでフィジカルに表現することを重要視している。生の振動、操作された（またはされない）テープ、骨格のリズム、破損した周波数、時にはエレクトリックギターを使用し、細分化されるジャンルや明確な音楽シーン、「パリのノイズ」シーンから離れることを試み続けている。（きっとパリに住んでいない多くの人々には、彼の国籍や所在地を知るすべはなかったはずでしょう。）<br/>
